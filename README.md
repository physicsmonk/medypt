MEDYPT is a Python library for simulating **ME**soscopic **DY**namics of
**P**hase **T**ransitions in materials.

It relies on the Python interface of [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) to solve the field equations,
and is itself a pure Python package, so it is very easy to install on any plantform.

Currently in development stage and not ready for release, but a preliminary 
[documentation](https://medypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) has been 
published for anyone interested.
