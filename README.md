MEDYPT is a Python library for simulating **ME**soscopic **DY**namics of
**P**hase **T**ransitions in materials. It is suited to simulate microstructure evolution and its physical responses
subject to various external stimuli.

It relies on the Python interface of [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) to solve the field equations,
and is itself a pure Python package, so it is very easy to install on any platform.

For details, see its [documentation](https://medypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
